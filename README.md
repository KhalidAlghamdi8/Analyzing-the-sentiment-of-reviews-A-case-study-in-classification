create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).
This task is an example of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, 
including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification.


analyzing the accuracy of your classifier, implement an actual classifier in a Jupyter notebook, 
and take a first stab at a core piece of the intelligent application you will build and deploy in your capstone.
